<h1>No cookies? Why we are different.</h1>

<p>Many websites today display cookie notices.</p>

<p>This is because they collect visitor data — for advertising, tracking or usage analytics.</p>

<p>We deliberately choose not to do this.</p>

<p>This website:</p>

<p>
– uses no tracking<br>
– stores no personal data<br>
– uses no advertising networks<br>
– analyzes no user behaviour
</p>

<p>It works without surveillance.</p>

<p>We believe privacy is not a luxury, but something natural.</p>

<p>That is why you do not see a cookie banner here.</p>

<p>Welcome to a website you can simply read.</p>
